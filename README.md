# Neatline Basemaps

This is a collection of additional basemaps that can be used with
Neatline in your theme.

## Installation

Theme developers can [submodule][sub] this repository if they wish to provide
access to additional base maps:

```
$ cd path/to/theme
$ git submodule add https://github.com/waynegraham/neatline_basemaps.git
```

If you are running your own instance of Omeka, you can add this to the
theme you are currently using on the server:

```
$ cd path/to/omeka/themes/current_theme/
$ git clone https://github.com/waynegraham/neatline_basemaps.git
```

You may want to look through these and remove any files you do not plan
to use.
